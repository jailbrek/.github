## Rootless & Rootful Support

This repository is designed to support both **rootless** and **rootful** tweaks, ensuring compatibility with various jailbreak configurations. Developers are welcome to share their tweaks regardless of the jailbreak method they target.

- **Rootless Tweaks**: Focused on modern jailbreaks that prioritize security and system integrity.
- **Rootful Tweaks**: Target traditional jailbreak setups with full root access.

We are actively working to expand the repository’s support to cater to both configurations seamlessly.
